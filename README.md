# RepTree

A tree data structure using CRDTs for seamless replication between peers.

## Description

RepTree uses 2 conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) to manage seamless replication between peers:
- A move tree CRDT is used for the tree structure (https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/move-op.pdf).
- A last writer wins (LWW) CRDT is used for properties.

RepTree can also be viewed as a hierarchical, distributed database. For more details on its database capabilities, see [RepTree as a Database](docs/database.md).

## Installation

```bash
npm install reptree
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { RepTree } from 'reptree';

// Create a new tree
const tree = new RepTree('peer1');

// Root vertex is created automatically
const rootVertex = tree.createRoot();
rootVertex.name = 'Project';

// Create a folder structure with properties
const docsFolder = rootVertex.newNamedChild('Docs');
docsFolder.setProperties({
  type: 'folder',
  icon: 'folder-icon'
});

const imagesFolder = rootVertex.newNamedChild('Images');
imagesFolder.setProperties({
  type: 'folder',
  icon: 'image-icon'
});

// Add files to folders
const readmeFile = docsFolder.newNamedChild('README.md');
readmeFile.setProperties({
  type: 'file',
  size: 2048,
  lastModified: '2023-10-15T14:22:10Z',
  s3Path: 's3://my-bucket/docs/README.md'
});

const logoFile = imagesFolder.newNamedChild('logo.png');
logoFile.setProperties({
  type: 'file',
  size: 15360,
  dimensions: '512x512',
  format: 'png',
  s3Path: 's3://my-bucket/images/logo.png'
});

// Move a file to a different folder
logoFile.moveTo(docsFolder);

// Get children of a folder
const docsFolderContents = docsFolder.children;

// Syncing between trees
const otherTree = new RepTree('peer2');
const ops = tree.getAllOps();
otherTree.merge(ops);
```
