# Yjs Integration

Yjs support was removed from this branch to keep RepTree lightweight and focused on the core LWW property model.

- Historical implementation is available on the `yjs-2025` branch
- We may reintroduce Yjs in the future as an optional extension/package

If you need collaborative editing with Yjs today, check out the `yjs-2025` branch and adapt the integration as an add-on to this core library.
