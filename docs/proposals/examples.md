# Interactive RepTree Examples Website

## Overview

This proposal outlines a plan to create an interactive examples website for RepTree using SvelteKit, housed within the main repository. The website will showcase RepTree's capabilities through a series of progressively complex demonstrations, from basic usage to advanced collaborative applications.

## Goals

- Demonstrate RepTree's core functionality in an interactive, visual way
- Provide practical examples for developers to understand and adopt RepTree
- Showcase the power of CRDTs for collaborative applications
- Serve as both documentation and marketing for the package

## Technical Setup

- **Framework**: SvelteKit
- **Structure**: Single repository with the examples website in a dedicated directory
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages or Vercel
- **Development**: Local development server with hot reloading

## Proposed Examples

### 1. Basic Tree Operations

- **Simple Tree Builder**: Interactive tree creation with drag-and-drop nodes
- **Property Editor**: Demonstrate setting and getting properties on vertices
- **Tree Visualization**: Real-time visualization of the tree structure
- **Serialization**: Show how to save and load trees

### 2. Replication and Synchronization

- **Two-Peer Sync**: Visual demonstration of two RepTree instances syncing changes
- **Operation Visualization**: Visualize the operations being exchanged
- **Conflict Resolution**: Show how concurrent edits are resolved
- **Network Partitioning**: Simulate network partitions and reconnections

### 3. Collaborative Applications

- **Collaborative File Explorer**: Multi-user file system with real-time updates
- **Shared Kanban Board**: Task management with movable cards and lists
- **Collaborative Mindmap**: Multi-user mindmapping tool
- **Shared Organizational Chart**: Collaborative org chart editor

### 4. Advanced Features

- **Text Editor Integration**: Combine RepTree with a rich text CRDT (like Yjs)
- **Drawing Canvas**: Collaborative drawing application with RepTree managing layers
- **Database Example**: Show RepTree used as a hierarchical database
- **Custom CRDT Types**: Demonstrate extending RepTree with custom CRDT types

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Examples

1. Create SvelteKit project structure within the repo
2. Implement basic styling and navigation
3. Develop the first set of simple examples
4. Add comprehensive documentation for each example

### Phase 2: Intermediate Examples

1. Develop replication and synchronization examples
2. Create visual tools to inspect tree state and operations
3. Add network simulation controls
4. Enhance documentation with interactive explanations

### Phase 3: Advanced Examples

1. Implement collaborative application examples
2. Create more complex integrations (text editor, canvas)
3. Optimize for performance with large datasets
4. Add downloadable code snippets for each example

## Technical Considerations

- **State Management**: Use Svelte stores for local state management
- **WebSocket/WebRTC**: For real-time synchronization between peers
- **Visualization**: D3.js or similar for tree visualization
- **Storage**: LocalStorage/IndexedDB for persistence between sessions
- **Offline Support**: Enable examples to work offline where possible

## User Experience

- Progressive disclosure: Simple examples first, with links to more complex ones
- Interactive tutorials guiding users through key concepts
- Live code editing to modify examples in real-time
- Split-screen views showing code alongside the visualization

## Development Workflow

1. Develop examples alongside package updates
2. Automated tests to ensure examples remain functional
3. Regular deployments to showcase the latest features
4. Integration with package documentation

## Conclusion

An interactive examples website will significantly enhance RepTree's adoption and understanding. By showcasing its capabilities through progressively complex, visual examples, developers can better understand the power of tree-based CRDTs and how to implement them in their own applications.

The SvelteKit-based approach provides a modern, fast development experience while keeping the examples tightly integrated with the main repository, ensuring they stay up-to-date with the latest package developments.
