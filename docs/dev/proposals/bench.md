# RepTree Benchmarking Proposal

## Overview

This document outlines a proposal for implementing performance benchmarking in RepTree using Vitest's benchmarking capabilities. The goal is to establish a consistent methodology for measuring and tracking performance across different versions of RepTree.

## Objectives

1. Establish baseline performance metrics for core RepTree operations
2. Create reproducible benchmarks for comparing performance between versions
3. Identify performance bottlenecks in the codebase
4. Provide data-driven insights for optimization efforts
5. Track performance impacts of new features and optimizations

## What to Measure

### 1. Core Operations Performance

- **Tree Structure Operations**
  - Vertex creation (newVertex, newNamedVertex)
  - Vertex movement (moveVertex)
  - Vertex deletion (deleteVertex)
  - Tree traversal (getChildren, getAncestors, getVertexByPath)

- **Property Operations**
  - Property access (getVertexProperty, getVertexProperties)
  - Property modification (setVertexProperty, setVertexProperties)
  - Transient property operations

### 2. Synchronization Performance

- **Operation Handling**
  - Operation merging (merge)
  - Operation application (applyOps, applyOpsOptimizedForLotsOfMoves)
  - Local operation generation and extraction (popLocalOps)

- **State Vector Operations**
  - State vector calculation
  - Missing operations calculation (getMissingOps)
  - State vector size scaling

### 3. Memory Usage

- **Tree Size Scaling**
  - Memory usage for trees of different sizes
  - Impact of operation history on memory usage
  - State vector memory overhead

### 4. Yjs Integration Performance

- **CRDT Property Updates**
  - Performance of Yjs document property handling
  - Collaborative editing scenarios
  - Conflict resolution performance

## Implementation Approach

### Benchmarking Tool: Vitest Bench

We'll leverage Vitest's benchmarking capabilities since we're already using Vitest for testing. This provides:

- Consistent measurement methodology
- Integration with our existing test infrastructure
- Ability to run benchmarks as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Statistical analysis of benchmark results

### Benchmark Structure

```typescript
// Example benchmark structure
import { bench, describe } from 'vitest'
import { RepTree } from '../src/RepTree'

describe('RepTree Core Operations', () => {
  bench('vertex creation', () => {
    const tree = new RepTree('peer1')
    const root = tree.createRoot()
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      tree.newVertex(root.id, { name: `vertex-${i}` })
    }
  })

  bench('property access', () => {
    // Setup tree with properties
    const tree = new RepTree('peer1')
    const root = tree.createRoot()
    const vertex = tree.newVertex(root.id, { name: 'test-vertex' })
    
    // Benchmark property access
    for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      tree.getVertexProperty(vertex.id, 'name')
    }
  })
})
```

### Benchmark Categories

We'll organize benchmarks into the following categories:

1. **Micro-benchmarks**: Focused on specific operations in isolation
2. **Macro-benchmarks**: Measuring real-world scenarios with multiple operations
3. **Scaling benchmarks**: Measuring performance as tree size increases
4. **Memory benchmarks**: Tracking memory usage patterns

### Visualization and Reporting

For each benchmark run, we'll generate reports that include:

- Execution time (mean, median, min, max)
- Operations per second
- Memory usage statistics
- Comparison with previous benchmark results

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Setup Benchmarking Infrastructure**
   - Add Vitest bench configuration
   - Create benchmark directory structure
   - Implement basic benchmark runner

2. **Phase 2: Core Operation Benchmarks**
   - Implement benchmarks for tree structure operations
   - Implement benchmarks for property operations
   - Establish baseline performance metrics

3. **Phase 3: Synchronization Benchmarks**
   - Implement benchmarks for operation handling
   - Implement benchmarks for state vector operations
   - Measure performance with different synchronization patterns

4. **Phase 4: Memory and Scaling Benchmarks**
   - Implement memory usage tracking
   - Create benchmarks with varying tree sizes
   - Measure performance scaling characteristics

5. **Phase 5: Yjs Integration Benchmarks**
   - Benchmark Yjs document property handling
   - Measure collaborative editing performance
   - Test conflict resolution scenarios

## Integration with Development Workflow

- **Local Development**: Developers can run benchmarks locally to assess performance impact of changes
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Benchmarks will run automatically on pull requests
- **Release Process**: Performance metrics will be included in release notes
- **Regression Detection**: Automatic detection of performance regressions

## Conclusion

Implementing a comprehensive benchmarking system will provide valuable insights into RepTree's performance characteristics and help guide optimization efforts. By establishing baseline metrics and tracking performance over time, we can ensure that RepTree continues to meet performance expectations as the codebase evolves.
